The Smart Campus Energy Lab (SCEL) was created in 2010 with the intent of 
tackling the task of creating a low-cost, self sustaining meteorological sensor 
platform. Initially a project of Justin Carland, that particular project has 
become one of the largest projects that SCEL has.

SCEL joined the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program in Fall 2015.

The Smart Campus Energy Lab at UH Manoa is a student-led lab that strives to be
<strong>a welcoming and open place of learning for undergraduate and graduate students 
alike</strong>, fostering and developing technical skills such as software engineering, 
circuit design and machine learning. In addition to technical skills, SCEL also 
focuses on developing “soft” skills such as communication, teamwork, project 
management and leadership.
