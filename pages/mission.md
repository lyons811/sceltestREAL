The Smart Campus Energy Lab at UH Manoa is a student-led lab that strives to be 
a welcoming and open place of learning for undergraduate and graduate students 
alike, fostering and developing technical skills such as software engineering, 
circuit design and machine learning. In addition to technical skills, SCEL also 
focuses on developing “soft” skills such as communication, teamwork, project 
management and leadership.

These are the core pillars of the lab:
<ol>
    <li>All procedures and projects will be open for the public to see.</li>
    <li>All hardware and software projects will be open sourced</li>
    <li>Students will be given the encouragement and opportunity to mentor others</li>
</ol>
