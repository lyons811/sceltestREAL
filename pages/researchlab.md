<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
defines a laboratory as “a facility that provides controlled conditions in 
which scientific or technological research, experiments, and measurement may be performed”.

When you join a research lab, you can expect to make contributions to some sort 
of a research project or experiment. In the engineering department, there are 
more direct projects rather than experimental projects. Research topics can be 
very broad and encompass many different disciplines.

Research labs also act as a bridge between classroom learning and practical 
application. Such labs usually have a technical theme to them; the concepts and 
theory taught in classrooms can be just as important as the practical 
application of those concepts.

Often, research labs operate more like engineering teams that accomplish a 
specific goal. For example, a lab might have a contract with a company to 
produce some sort of experimental product.
