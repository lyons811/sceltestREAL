  It's easy to get involved with our lab! We are always looking for curious,
  motivated, and enthusiastic students who are interested in our lab. If you're
  interested in joining our lab, go through the following steps:
  </p>

  <h3> Look through our research projects and topic areas. </h3>

  <p>
  The listing of research projects and topic areas will give you a better idea
  of the type of work we do and what you would be doing if you joined our lab.
  It is not necessary to already have the skills required to work on the projects;
  nor is it required to have knowledge of all of the topics covered.
