Why join SCEL?

We strive to create a lab where students can learn and apply the knowledge they have gained from classes to a real life application. In addition to this, we also hope to equip our students with professional skills essential for their careers after school. Overall, we work toward developing well rounded students ready for success after college.

<h2>Technical EE/CompE Skills</h2>
One of the main reasons our lab exists is to provide students a place to 
practice their technical skills and learn additional skills. This lab is a great
place to apply what you learned in your classes and transform them into 
something real. We have a lot of EE related topics like PCB design, circuit 
design, signal processing and programming.

<h2>Networking</h2>
We provide our students opportunities to network with professors and students 
within as well as outside the EE department. We also regularly talk with people 
in industry to gain insights and advice on how to improve our project or new 
technologies we should consider using. Within the lab, we also hold team outings
and activities.

<h2>Professional Development</h2>
We prepare our students for their careers after college in the professional 
field. In our lab, students work on their communication and presentation skills 
as well as how to work on a team.

<h2>Leadership</h2>
We are always looking for the next generation of leaders in our lab. Working on 
the leadership team provides our students with valuable experience in project 
management, organization, and time management.

<h2>Papers and Conferences</h2>
Our lab has successfully published several papers, and we have sent a few 
students to conferences on the mainland.
