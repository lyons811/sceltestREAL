The following are various positions in our lab, and the skills associated with 
them. We do not expect students to possess all the skills listed for the 
positions. As with any engineering project, you may not have knowledge of 
everything, but you learn as you go. We just require the students in our lab to 
be willing to put the time and effort into learning. So don't be discouraged to 
try for a position even if you don't have all the skills needed. Look at the 
list of skills as techniques and tools you will acquire and deepen your 
knowledge in as you go.

Often, students in the lab work on multiple topics and have a lot of overlap 
between these positions. We encourage everyone to try different topics and see 
what they like. You are not limited to something once you choose it.
