# SCEL Website.

The [Website](https://scel-hawaii.org) for Smart Campus Energy Lab.

## Website Development Methodology

Since not all of the SCEL members have a software background, we use the
our main [wiki](https://wiki.scel-hawaii.org/) as the main store
for institutional knowledge. Therefore, most content should be updated
on the wiki first and then communicated to the web team to update the
website.
